# Learning from my Mistakes
## When making the flex boxes
- I was having a hard time contemplating what containers where effecting what items.
- I watched some of the videos recommended and started to teach it.
### A few things I learned
- 'display: flex' creates a box around items.
- by default all flex boxes are in rows
- 'flex-direction: column' will put the items in a column
#### These are a few main components I use to fix my layout problems
